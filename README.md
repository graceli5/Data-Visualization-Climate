Project: Practicing querying, joining, and visualizing databases to depict the historical effects of Global Warming.

This notebook takes in monthly temperature data from weather stations around the world, focusing on the two time periods of 1901-1910 and 2011-2020. After cleaning and merging datasets to extract the countries of each station, I employ subplots, lineplots and barplots to visualize trends and time-series patterns in different geographic areas. These graphs overwhelmingly support the conclsion that around the world and throughout the year, temperatures are significantly higher than they were a century ago.
